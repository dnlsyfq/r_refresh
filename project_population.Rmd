This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

# ```{r}
# plot(cars)
# ```

```{r,error=TRUE}
calculate_annual_growth <-function(year_one,year_two,pop_y1,pop_y2,city){
  annual_growth <- (((pop_y2 - pop_y1) / pop_y1) * 100) / (year_two - year_one)
  message <- paste("From", year_one, "to", year_two, "the population of", city, "grew by approximately", annual_growth, "% each year.")
  return(annual_growth)
}
```

```{r}
city_name <- "Istanbul, Turkey"
pop_year_one <- 691000
pop_year_two <- 15029231
pop_change <- pop_year_two - pop_year_one
```

```{r}
percentage_gr <- (pop_change/pop_year_one) * 100
print(percentage_gr)
```
```{r}
annual_gr <- percentage_gr/(2017-1927)
print(annual_gr)
```

```{r}
calculate_annual_growth(1927,2017,pop_year_one,pop_year_two,'Istanbul')

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
